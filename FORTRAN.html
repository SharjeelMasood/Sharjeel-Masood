        <h1>FORTRAN: The First Practical Programming Language That Changed Computing</h1>

        <p>
            Before FORTRAN, programming was extremely difficult. Developers had to write instructions directly in
            machine or assembly language. FORTRAN transformed computing by introducing human-readable programming.
        </p>

        <h2>Origins of FORTRAN</h2>
        <p>
            FORTRAN was created in 1957 by John Backus and his team at IBM. The goal was to allow scientists and
            engineers to write programs more easily and efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>The Need for a High-Level Language</h2>
        <p>
            Early computers were powerful but difficult to program. FORTRAN allowed developers to focus on
            problem-solving instead of hardware details.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features Introduced by FORTRAN</h2>
        <p>
            FORTRAN introduced variables, loops, conditional statements, mathematical expressions, and reusable
            subroutines — features that are fundamental in modern programming languages.
        </p>

        <h2>Performance and Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest achievements of FORTRAN was its compiler, which produced highly optimized machine code.
            This made FORTRAN programs fast and reliable.
        </p>

        <h2>Scientific and Industrial Impact</h2>
        <p>
            FORTRAN became the backbone of scientific computing, aerospace research, weather prediction, nuclear
            simulations, and engineering calculations.
        </p>

        <h2>FORTRAN in Modern Times</h2>
        <p>
            Even today, FORTRAN is used in supercomputers and high-performance systems. Many legacy systems still rely
            on it due to its efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy in Modern Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python borrowed core ideas from FORTRAN. Without FORTRAN, modern
            programming might look very different.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Developers Should Learn This History</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding FORTRAN helps developers appreciate abstraction, performance optimization, and the evolution
            of programming concepts.
        </p>

        <p>
            FORTRAN proved that programming could be powerful, efficient, and accessible. It set the standard for all
            future programming languages.
